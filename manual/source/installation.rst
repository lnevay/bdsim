Obtaining  BDSIM
================

BDSIM may be obtained either from the BDSIM website from the GIT repository
(https://www.bitbucket.org/stewartboogert/bdsim). The user must compile it on
their system and must have Geant4 already present (or access to AFS).

..  _from-git-repository:

From the GIT Repository
-----------------------

To download the source from the git repository, use the command::

  git clone https://bitbucket.org/stewartboogert/bdsim

This will create a directory called ``bdsim``, inside which all the code, examples
and documentation is provided. To obtain the python utilities that come with BDSIM,
use the following commands::

  > cd bdsim
  > git submodule init
  > git submodule update
  

Requirements
============

1) `Geant4`_ installed or access to **AFS** [#macafsnote]_. Version 4.9.6 or higher.
2) `CMake`_ 2.6.4 or higher
3) Flex 2.5.37 or higher
4) Bison 2.3 or higher
5) `CLHEP`_ 2.1.3.1 or higher
6) `Boost`_ libraries

Optional dependencies
  
7) `ROOT`_ framework for binary data output

Note, even though installed, the Geant4 environmental variables must be
available. You can test this in a terminal with::

  > echo $G4 <tab>
  $G4ABLADATA         $G4NEUTRONHPDATA    $G4RADIOACTIVEDATA  
  $G4LEDATA           $G4NEUTRONXSDATA    $G4REALSURFACEDATA  
  $G4LEVELGAMMADATA   $G4PIIDATA          $G4SAIDXSDATA
     
If these do not exists, please source the Geant4 environmental script
before installing BDSIM and each time before using BDSIM. It is common
to add this to your ``.bashrc`` or profile so that it's loaded automatically
every time.::

  source path/to/geant4/installation/bin/geant4.sh

Note, if Geant4 is not installed, please see `Geant4 Installation Guide`_.


Setting Up
==========

The following sections detail the setup process for different operating systems.

Mac OSX
-------

We recommend obtaining `required packages <Requirements>`_ using `MacPorts`_ package manager,
although they can be obtained both through other package managers and by
manually downloading, compiling and installing the source for each.

Once ready, make a directory **outside** the BDSIM source directory to build
BDSIM in::

  > ls
  bdsim
  > mkdir bdsim-build
  > ls
  bdsim bdsim-build

It is important that the build directory be outside the source directory as otherwise
trouble may be encountered when receiving further updates from the git repository.
From this directory use the following CMake command to configure the BDSIM
installation::

  > cd bdsim-build
  > cmake ../bdsim

This typically produces the following output, which is slightly different on each computer::

CMake will search your system for the required dependencies. In the above example, this
proceeded without any errors. In the case where a required dependency cannot be found,
an error will be shown and CMake will stop. Please see `Configuring the BDSIM Build with
CMake`_ for further details on how to fix this and further configure the BDSIM installation.

You can then compile BDSIM with::

  > make

BDSIM can then be installed for access from anywhere on the system with::
  
  > sudo make install

To change the installation directory, see `Configuring the BDSIM Build with CMake`_.
From any directory on your computer, ``bdsim`` should be available.

.. note:: This step is not stictly necessary. It is possible to simply create an alias to the
	  exectuable ``bdsim`` that exists in the build directory in your shell profile. This
	  is common practice for developers who may wish to have a debug build of the code as
	  well as the normal release build.

From the build directory you can verify your installation using a series of tests
included with BDSIM. ::

  > ctest -E LONG


Scientific Linux
----------------

Install the `required packages <Requirements>`_ preferably with a
package manager.

For SL5 you will have to use Geant 4.9.6 as Geant 4.10 onwards is not compatible.
Older version of Geant4 can be downloaded from their
`archive <http://geant4.web.cern.ch/geant4/support/source_archive.shtml>`_ . 
For SL6, we recommend the latest version of Geant4, currently 4.10.1.  
Once ready, make a directory **outside** the BDSIM source directory to build
BDSIM in::

  > ls
  bdsim
  > mkdir bdsim-build
  > ls
  bdsim          bdsim-build

It is important that the build directory be outside the source directory as otherwise
trouble may be encountered when receiving further updates from the git repository.
From this directory use the following CMake command to configure the BDSIM
installation::

  > cd bdsim-build
  > cmake ../bdsim

You can then compile BDSIM with::

  > make

BDSIM can then be installed for access from anywhere on the system with::

From any directory on your computer, ``bdsim`` should be available.  From the build directory
you can verify your installation using a series of tests included with BDSIM.::

  > ctest -E LONG

Linux with AFS Access
---------------------

When the machine has AFS connection, the latest stable release binary is available::

   /afs/cern.ch/user/j/jsnuveri/public/bdsim

Before using the binary you must source the geant4 setup::

   source /afs/cern.ch/user/j/jsnuveri/public/geant4.10-setup.sh

When compiling BDSIM from source, the dependent packages like Geant4 can
be taken from AFS and don't need to be compiled and installed locally. The same
compiler version needs to be used for BDSIM as the one that was used for Geant4.
The following scripts must be sourced before using CMake.  

For the versions 0.61 and onwards::

  source /afs/cern.ch/user/j/jsnuveri/public/gcc47-setup.sh
  source /afs/cern.ch/user/j/jsnuveri/public/geant4.10-setup.sh

For version 0.6 and older::
  
  source /afs/cern.ch/user/j/jsnuveri/public/gcc46-setup.sh
  source /afs/cern.ch/user/j/jsnuveri/public/geant4.9.6-setup.sh

After this, the installation procedure for `Scientific Linux`_ should be followed.


Configuring the BDSIM Build with CMake
--------------------------------------

To either enter paths to dependencies manually, or edit the configuration, the following
command will give you and interface to CMake (from ``bdsim-build`` directory)::

  > ccmake .

.. image:: figures/cmake_screenshot.jpg
   :width: 80%
   :align: center

You can then use **up** and **down** arrows to select the desired parameter and
**enter** to edit it. If the parameter is a path, press **enter** again after
entering the path to confirm.

Once the parameter has been edited, you can proceed by pressing **c** to run
the configuration and if successful, follow this by **g** to generate the
build. After configuring the installation, you should run::

  > make
  > sudo make install

Note, ``sudo`` is used here as the default installation directory will be a
system folder. You can however, specify a different directory in the above **ccmake**
configuration and that won't require the ``sudo`` command. The installation directory
can be specified by editing the ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` variable.

Making the Manual
-----------------

The manual is available online at http://www.pp.rhul.ac.uk/bdsim/manual and included
as a pdf in the source directory, but if
desired the user can compile the manual in both HTML and pdflatex from the build
directory using the following command::

  > make manual

to make the HTML manual in the folder ``manual/html``. Similarly::

  > make manual-pdf

will make the pdf Manual in the folder ``manual/latex``.

.. note:: This requires the sphinx documentation system to be installed and all utility
	  python packages to be availbe in python from any directory. The latexpdf build
	  requuires a full installation of pdflatex to be available as well.


Making Doxygen Code Documentation
---------------------------------

From the build directory run the following command::

  > make doc

to make the Doxygen documentation in a folder called ``Doxygen``.

.. note:: This requires the Doxygen documentation system to be installed.

Geant4 Installation Guide
-------------------------

As of version 0.6, BDSIM builds with the most recent versions of Geant4 (version 4.9.6 onwards).
If not built with **MacPorts** then download the 4.10.01 version or an older version from the
Geant archive. Move and unpack to a suitable place ::

  > tar -xzf geant4.10.04.tar.gz
  > ls
  geant4.10.04

Make a build and installation directory **outside** that directory ::
  
  > mkdir geant4.10.04-build
  > mkdir geant4.10.04-install

Configure Geant4 using CMake ::

  > cd geant4.10.04-build
  > cmake ../geant4.10.04

At this point it's useful to define the installation directory for Geant4 by
modifying the CMake configuration as generally described in
`Configuring the BDSIM Build with CMake`_. ::

  > ccmake .

Once the installation directory is set, press ``c`` to run the configuration
process, and when complete, press ``g`` to generate the build. Geant4 can then
be compiled ::

  > make

Note, Geant4 can take around 20 minutes to compile on a typical computer. If your
computer has multiple cores, you can significantly decrease the time required to
compile by using extra cores ::

  > make -jN

where ``N`` is the number of cores on your computer [#ncoresnote]_. Geant4 should
then be installed ::

  > make install

Note, if you've specified the directory to install, you will not need the ``sudo``
command, however, if you've left the settings as default, it'll be installed
in a colder that requires ``sudo`` permissions such as ``/usr/local/``.

**IMPORTANT** - you should source the Geant4 environment each time before running
BDSIM as this is required for the physics models of Geant4.  This can be done using ::

  > source path/to/geant4.10.04-install/bin/geant4.sh

It may be useful to add this command to your ``.bashrc`` or profile script.

Troubleshooting
===============

Below are a list of possible encountered problems. If you experience problems beyond these,
please contact us (see :ref:`support-section`).

1) Visualisation does not work::

     "parameter value is not listed in the candidate List."
   
   Check which graphics systems BDSIM has available, this is shown in the terminal when
   you run BDSIM ::
     
     You have successfully registered the following graphics systems.
     Current available graphics systems are:
     ASCIITree (ATree)
     DAWNFILE (DAWNFILE)
     G4HepRep (HepRepXML)
     G4HepRepFile (HepRepFile)
     OpenGLImmediateQt (OGLI, OGLIQt)
     OpenGLImmediateX (OGLIX)
     OpenGLImmediateXm (OGLIXm, OGLI_FALLBACK, OGLIQt_FALLBACK)
     OpenGLStoredQt (OGL, OGLS, OGLSQt)
     OpenGLStoredX (OGLSX)
     OpenGLStoredXm (OGLSXm, OGL_FALLBACK, OGLS_FALLBACK, OGLSQt_FALLBACK)
     RayTracer (RayTracer)
     RayTracerX (RayTracerX)
     VRML1FILE (VRML1FILE)
     VRML2FILE (VRML2FILE)
     gMocrenFile (gMocrenFile)
   
   If your favourite is not there check that Geant4 is correctly compiled with those
   graphics system.

2) Error from OpenGL::
     
     G4OpenGLImmediateX::CreateViewer: error flagged by negative view id in
     G4OpenGLImmediateXViewer creation.

   Check that your graphics card driver is installed correctly for your memory card
   and possibly reinstall them. For Ubuntu for example, run::

     fglrxinfo

   If fglrx is installed and working well you should see an output similar to::
     
     > fglrxinfo
     display: :0  screen: 0
     OpenGL vendor string: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.
     OpenGL renderer string: ATI Radeon HD 4300/4500 Series       
     OpenGL version string: 3.3.11399 Compatibility Profile Context

   For more info see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/AMD

3) Build does not work - GLIBCXX errors, where a message similar to this is shown ::

     Linking CXX executable bdsim
     /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/external/geant4/9.6.p02/x86_64-slc6-gcc46-opt
     /lib64/libG4analysis.so: undefined reference to
     'std::__detail::_List_node_base::_M_unhook()@GLIBCXX_3.4.15'
   
   This means compiler version for BDSIM is different from the one used to compile Geant4.
   Make sure it is the same compiler version. Remember to start from a clean build
   directory otherwise CMake does **NOT** update the compiler version.


.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#macafsnote] Note, the use of **AFS** with the Mac OSX build of BDISM is not supported
		 as there is no compatible version of Geant4 available on AFS.

.. [#ncoresnote] If your computer supports hyper-threading, you can use twice the number of
		 cores with the ``make -jN`` command. Ie a computer has 4 cores and supports
		 hyper-threading, can support up to ``make -j8``.  Exceeding this number will
		 result in slower than normal compilation.
