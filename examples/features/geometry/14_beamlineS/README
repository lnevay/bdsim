simpleCollimator (sc)
---------------------

sc.gmad			normal example (adapted to have twiss beam parameters)
sc_loss.gmad		normal example (with larger emittance to give loss)
sc_beamlineS.gmad 	is shifted by option, beamlineS=XX*m;
sc_beamlineS_loss.gmad  is shifted by option, beamlineS=XX*m with losses to check loss histograms
