 * @brief A diamond-shaped aperture with optional curved edges.
 *
 * Note, that when this is expanded the horizontal and vertical extent
 * will increase by more than that value. This is because the expansion
 * is done to keep a constant thickness around the edge but this results
 * in a greater extent at each edge (depending on the proportions).
