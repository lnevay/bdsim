/**
 * @brief Exact helix through pure dipole field.
 *
 * Integrator based on G4MagHelicalStepper that provides required
 * tracking througha pure magnetic field, but is a pure virtual class.
 * 
 * This class implements the required Stepper method that uses the provided
 * AdvanceHelix method from the base class.
 *
 * Unlike other BDSIM integrators this works in global coordinates and does
 * not require the transforms to curvilinear coordinates.
 *
 * For low momentum particles (|p| < 40 MeV) we use the G4ClassicalRK4 integrator
 * instead of the one for the pure magnetic field as it is more robust.
