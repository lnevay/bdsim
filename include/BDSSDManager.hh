/**
 * @brief A singleton class that holds all required sensitive
 * detector class instances.  Each sensitive detector class
 * need only be instantiated once and attached to the relevant
 * volume. More factorised geometry construction will mean
 * SDs will be assigned in construction and not in detector
 * construciton afterwards as a post processing step. This 
 * instantiates all necessary SDs and holds them.
