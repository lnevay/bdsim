/**
 * @brief Common functionality to BDSIM integrators.
 * 
 * This is a base class for BDSIM provided integrators that ignore the true 
 * field value supplied to the integrator from Geant4 and simply integrate the
 * the motion based on the design rigidity and a strength parameter.
 * 
 * This also provides a general 4th order Runge Kutta integrator that can be used
 * by the derived class if the coordinates are non-parraxial for example.
 *
 * The derived class must also satisfy G4MagIntegratorStepper.hh's virtual method
 * Stepper.
