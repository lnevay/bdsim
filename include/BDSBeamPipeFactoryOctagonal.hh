/**
 * @brief Factory for octagonal aperture model beampipes.
 * 
 * This is a rectangular aperture with faceted flat corners. In the 
 * positive quadrant (+ve x & y) the user specifies (x,y) of the full
 * width in the horizontal and the full height in the vertical. A
 * second set of (x,y) coordinates specify the x and y points of the 
 * cut points. Therefore, the second x,y are always <  than the first ones.
 * This is reflected in all four quadrants. Practically, a G4ExtrudedSolid
 * is used where simply points are defined and this shape is extruded.
 *
 * aper1,2 are used to represent x1,y1 and aper3,4 are x2,y2 respectively.
 * 
 * Singleton pattern.
