 * @brief Factory for simple parallel geometry for curvilinear coordinates.
 *
 * This builds a beam line of geometry based on an existing beam line. It makes
 * simple shapes with the correct length and angle of each component. In the case
 * of a straight component (no angle) it's a box and in the case of an angled component
 * or one with face rotations, it's a G4CutTubs.
