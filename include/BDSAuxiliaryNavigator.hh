/**
 * @brief Extra G4Navigator object common to all steppers to get coordinate
 * transforms.
 * 
 * All BDSIM steppers and magnetic fields require the ability 
 * to convert from global to local coordinates. The prescribed method 
 * to do this is by using a G4Navigator instance. There is of course the 
 * main navigator for tracking, but requesting information on a global
 * point changes the state of the navigator - ie the particle being 
 * tracked by the navigator is now that point. This is VERY dangerous.
 * 
 * This class provides a static auxiliary navigator that each derived 
 * class can use. Making the auxilliary navigator static is not done 
 * to reduce memory usage but because navigating from an unknown place 
 * to anywhere in the geometry is
 * much more costly than a relative move in the geometry. If we only
 * use one auxiliary navigator, it will always be relatively close
 * in the geometry even if a different stepper has been used and 
 * therefore more efficient. This is important as Geant4 may use the
 * steppers at least two or three times to estimate the best next step
 * and the stepper itself may make three steps (full, and two half) to
 * estimate the error in the integration.
